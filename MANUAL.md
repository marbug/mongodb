# MongoDB manual #

Let's follow [MongoDB Manual](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/) first and note main points starting from current file.

## Getting Started ##

MongoDB manual has version of 'Getting Started' for different languages (Python, Java, etc) and some of them differs not only by language code but also by structure and info. That's why IMHO it's better to compare them later... TODO :)

So, let's start from [manual's introduction](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/)
